##Shader .cfg
SHADER = ShaderName
PROPERTIES
bool _ThisIsABool = true
int _ThisIsAnInt = 1
float _ThisIsAFloat = 1,1
color _ThisIsAColor = 0,123,255,300
texture _ThisIsAModAddedTexture = modid/images/cooltexture.png
texture _ThisIsAKSP2Texture = textureName
texture _ThisIsAWhiteTexture = white
texture _ThisIsANormalTexture = NORMAL

###Floats and Ints
Both floats and Ints can have min and max values, they are set like this:
defaultValue : minValue : maxValue
Example:
0,2 : 0 : 2 - This will tell TUX that your shader's default value is 0,2 and that value cannot be less than 0 or bigger than 2, this is mostly used on the UI

####Observations
Colors range from 0,255 any number below will be set as 0 and any number above as 255
KSP2 Textures must have the same name as in game (CaseSensitive)

##Overrides .cfg
SHADER = ShaderName
OVERRIDE = (PartName, GameObjectName)
_ThisIsABool = true
_ThisIsAnInt = 1
_ThisIsAFloat = 1,1f
_ThisIsAColor = 0,123,255,300
_ThisIsAModAddedTexture = modid/images/cooltexture.png
_ThisIsAKSP2Texture = textureName

####Observations
Any property not disclosed will be set as is on the original shader!
Colors range from 0,255 any number below will be set as 0 and any number above as 255
KSP2 Textures must have the same name as in game (CaseSensitive)

###Heres an example

SHADER = KSP2/Scenery/Standard (Opaque)
OVERRIDE = (engine_1v_methalox_swivel, Engine_Swivel)
ShaderPropertyName = Value
_SmoothnessOverride = true
_Metalic = 0,5f
_EmissionColor = 0,123,255,300
_MetallicMap = tux/images/coolMetallicMap.png
_PaintMaskGlossMap = pod_2v_lander_crew_pm


##There are also aliases for textures!
white texture = white, unitywhite
black texture = black, unityblack
normal/bump texture = normal, bump, unitynormalmap

Soon color aliases and more textures will be added!
